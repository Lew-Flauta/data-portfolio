# Lew Flauta
jr data scientist

### About me:
I am a Graduate of Computer Science from DePaul University in Chicago. I've worn a couple different hats in my journey: I have a background in Finance, Systems-Administration, and Development. I have been tagged with the monicker of being a Jack-of-Trades, master of none. I kept seeking out something to keep my passion, I never did until I fell into data-science and Machine Learning. I thought it was all in the future, and things wouldn't come to pass in my lifetime. I see that the future is now, and I can be a part of it! I will continue to be a Jack-of-all-trades, but I will also strive to be the Master-of-One...Data Science!
