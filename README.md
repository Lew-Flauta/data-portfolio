### Projects
* [NLP-categorization and ensemble](https://github.com/lewai/nlp-classification/blob/master/nlp%20categories.ipynb) - taking in a corpus of data and finding the category of item they belong to.
* [bike-sales](https://github.com/lewai/bikesales/blob/master/bike_sales.ipynb) - taking in a corpus of data and finding the category of item they belong to.
* Udacity Deep Racer Challenge – Created and tuned a reinforcement learning model hosted on AWS for a 1/18 scale Virtual race-car. Tuned learning hyper-parameters and reward/penalty functions to achieve a top 10% percent winning result in competition. 
* 10-Pin Bowling League Competition Analysis – Analyzed and cleaned league-bowling data to find predictors of a team winning in competition. Used k-means clustering to categorize bowler types of team composition. Developed a data pipeline that takes in a team’s bowlers, cleans the data, and predicts their chances of winning a bowling match.
* [Visualizing Earnings based on College Majors](https://github.com/Lew-Flauta/Earnings_based_on_college_majors/blob/master/Basics.ipynb) - Using Pandas to quickly show visualizations.
* [Ebay Car Sales](https://github.com/Lew-Flauta/ebay_car_sales/blob/master/Basics.ipynb) - Analyzing and Cleaning Ebay Car Sales.
* [US Gun Deaths](https://github.com/Lew-Flauta/US_gun_deaths/blob/master/Basics.ipynb) - some more analyzing data and beginning to see the power of data insights. 
* [US Births](https://github.com/Lew-Flauta/US_births/blob/master/Basics.ipynb) - my beginnings in parsing data with Python in Jupyter notebook.
* [Programming Portfolio](https://lewtech.github.io/projects/) - Various non-data programming projects
